    documentation="http://data.europa.eu/2sa/elap/code-ethics-compliance&#xA;Code of ethics compliance refers to the expression of important values and standards that are also to be found in the law, but not only aspects related to legally-binding issues. &#xA;Rationale&#xA;A code of ethics is a written set of expectations that an organization has for its employees to conduct business in an honest manner. Ethics are values and principles that govern behaviour or conduct. &#xA;&#xA;Apart from legislation, the European foundational text &quot;Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union&quot; sets up the different terms and relevant aspects for the proper function of the European Union. &#xA;&#xA;All public services provided by public administrations under European Union must be aligned and fully compliant with European Union values. &#xA;Principle Source&#xA;European Ombudsman"/>
