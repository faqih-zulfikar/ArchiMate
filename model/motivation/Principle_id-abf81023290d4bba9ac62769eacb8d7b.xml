Bounded on that fact, organisations develop their strategies and roadmaps accordingly, which implies the provision of funds and efforts to develop effective and efficient public services. &#xA;&#xA;The economic and technical efforts need to be monitored and tracked to ensure that policies are implemented without additional effort. At that point is where public administrations need to put mechanisms to follow-up on implementations and the attainment of public policy objectives. &#xA;Principle Source&#xA;Assessment of Effectiveness and Efficiency Underlying Principle (12) of the European Interoperability Framework (EIF)"/>
