In principle, achieving F, A and I should achieve most of R - but there is another important aspect of the reusability principle that needs to be resolved. When designing data collection processes, reusability beyond the original purpose must be considered. It is usually extremely difficult to make data that is not FAIR reusable after the fact. Data reusability must be in place from the beginning, i.e. context and tacit knowledge must be built in from the start. Otherwise, there is a risk that datasets will be found and analysed under false assumptions, leading to a disruption of projects and sometimes a reluctance of researchers to share 'their' data with others.&#xA;Principle Source&#xA;FAIR Principles"/>
