    documentation="Principle: &quot;Digital Interoperability should be verified&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;Whenever a Digital Public Service is developed or changed, the EIRA interoperability principles should be taken into consideration. &#xD;&#xA;The Interoparable Europe Act requires European Institutions and public sector bodies and agencies to run interoperability assessments in order to identify and consider digital and interoperability aspects early in the design phase of policies and digital public services. &#xD;&#xA;For this reason, the EIF principles are included in the principles view, and the EIRA interoperability goals that realise these principles are included in the Goals view. You can access these views by clicking on the view reference."/>
