    documentation="http://data.europa.eu/2sa/elap/loosely-coupled-integration&#xA;Organisations are loosely coupled with other organisations.&#xA;Rationale&#xA;Loosely coupled organisations are able to function with minimal dependency on other organisations. This enables faster implementation and change of digital public services. &#xA;&#xA;Any public organisation should avoid the entanglement of inter-organisational processes for performing activities, that spread over multiple organisations. The application for a visa, for instance, should be performed in a single transaction, from an applicant's perspective. Whether the process comprises multiple interactions between public institutions (like Frontex, Embassy, Interpol) or not, should be transparent to the applicant. Inter-organisational interfaces in this case should not duplicate the processes, using the same data and leading to the same outcome. Each organisation serves a unique part of the application process.&#xA;Principle Source&#xA;Organizations Social Systems Conducting Experiments"/>
